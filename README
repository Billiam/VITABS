VITABS
======

Introduction
------------
VITABS is a guitar tab editor inspired by the legendary Vi text editor.  It is
created with convenient editing and fast keyboard entry in mind.  Keyboard
mappings are modeled after Vi and Vim.  This is an early development version, so
there is no manual yet.  For default key bindings see mappings at the end of the
commands.py file.  Also, this project started as an excersise in python and
curses for me, so code quality may not be at it's finest, still an effort is
beeing taken to clean it up.

Python 2 and curses library are required to run VITABS.


Features
--------
For now, only loading/saving and basic editing features work.  Expect updates in
the upcoming time.  Planned features include multiple tracks, MIDI playback and
plugin support.
